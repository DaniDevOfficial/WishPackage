Wish Package is a simple school exercise on how react packages work. It is just a button that makes a sound when pressed.

```
Or you can also install it from the local version with the path

```bash
npm install file:path/to/WishPackage
```

## Usage

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { WishPackage } from 'wish-package';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <WishPackage />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## What does it do?

Its just a simple Component that plays a sound after the user Clicked a button. 

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export function WishPackage() {


    const sound = new Audio('https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/funnysoundswish.appspot.com/o/Sounds%2FUploaded%2FSound.mp3?alt=media&token=4cb9d5b8-d108-4966-b087-28ac9275a81c'); // this sound is loud

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Wish Package Counter</h1>
            <p>Wish Package Counter</p>
